📊 Sales Data Analysis Dashboard
This project is an advanced data analysis and visualization tool built with Python, using Pandas and Matplotlib. It processes sales data to generate insights like:

🔍 Total revenue by product

🌍 Revenue distribution across regions

📈 Time-series trend of daily revenue

All visualizations are exported as PNG charts, making the project useful for data reporting, presentations, and practice in real-world analysis workflows.
